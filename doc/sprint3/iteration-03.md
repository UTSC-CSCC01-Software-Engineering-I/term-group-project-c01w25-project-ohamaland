### Jira Board
- Used for task tracking and sprint planning.
- Tasks have a difficulty rating on a scale from **1 to 5**.
- Tasks are sorted by urgency in planning meetings, considering importance and impact on production.
- Example: Backend endpoints must be completed before frontend UI to ensure proper integration.
- Any changes are discussed in standups and through Discord for immediate updates.

### Task Assignment
- Assigned in planning meetings based on sprint goals.
- Assigned based on expertise and ensuring the right person works on a task.
- Motivation also plays a roleâ€”if a team member is interested in a task, they can take it on.
