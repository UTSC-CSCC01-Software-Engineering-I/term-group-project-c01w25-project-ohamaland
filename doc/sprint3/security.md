# **Security Measures & Testing**

### Authentication, Authorization, and Data Protection
- **Authentication**: The application employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected resources.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced, restricting users' permissions based on their roles.
- **Data Protection**: The application benefits from Django's built-in security features, including protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

### Security Best Practices
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using PBKDF2, enhancing resistance against brute force and dictionary attacks.
- **Input Validation**: 
  - Email, username, and name inputs are validated on the frontend using regular expressions to ensure proper formatting and prevent malformed data entry.
  - Additional server-side validation ensures robustness against improper input.

### Security Testing Results
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Django's ORM uses parameterized queries, making it resistant to SQL injection. No raw SQL queries are used.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**: React escapes content by default when rendering JSX, mitigating XSS risks. No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or direct DOM manipulation ensures protection against XSS.
- **CSRF Protection**: Djangoâ€™s built-in CSRF protection mechanisms are enabled, ensuring that malicious requests from unauthorized sources are blocked.
