## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

**When:** March 26, 2025  
**Where:** Online (Discord)

---

## Process - Reflection

### Decisions that turned out well

#### UI Overhaul Implementation:
- Comprehensive update of user interfaces improved overall application usability.
- Collaboration between design and development team members enhanced final outcomes.

#### API Restructuring:
- Simplified API architecture by switching from generic views to custom APIViews
- Achieved better code readability and control over request handling
- Enabled specialized business logic and custom validations
- Improved maintainability through explicit request/response handling
- Customized endpoints to better match application requirements
- Enhanced flexibility for implementing new features
- Fostered effective design and development collaboration

#### Effective Team Communication:
- Direct collaboration between UI designers and developers led to better alignment.
- Specific improvements in Figma design implementation through paired discussions.

#### Early Code Review and Cleanup:
- Frontend and backend code cleanup early in sprint improved development workflow.
- UI improvements enhanced navigation and user interaction patterns.

---

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

#### UI Development Time Management:
- Excessive time allocation to UI improvements reduced focus on other critical features.
- Better time distribution needed across different development aspects.
- Need to establish clearer UI development boundaries and timelines.

#### Task Sequencing and Dependencies:
- Project workflow had multiple dependency bottlenecks.
- Team members faced blockers due to unfinished dependent tasks.
- Need for better task prioritization and dependency management.
- Should implement parallel development strategies where possible.

---

## Planned Changes
- Task breakdown with clear dependencies to identify potential blockers early and manage workflow efficiently
- Parallel development approach to minimize bottlenecks and maximize team productivity
- Regular code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge across team members

## Product - Review

### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
- **New UI for Authentication:** Implemented modern login/register interfaces with enhanced user experience.
- **Authentication Integration:** Added secure authentication across all data endpoints.
- **Enhanced UI Components:** Created comprehensive designs for groups, receipts, and subscriptions.
- **Receipt Calculations:** Implemented tax and tips functionality in receipt processing.
- **Group Management Features:** Added update and delete capabilities for groups.
- **Delete Operations UI:** Implemented interfaces for removing receipts, groups, and subscriptions.
- **OCR Integration:** Successfully integrated optical character recognition for receipt processing.

### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
- **Tax and Tips Auto-calculation:** Several planned features for receipt calculations remained incomplete, including system validation, manual adjustments, and real-time updates.

## Meeting Highlights

### Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
1. **Streamlined Development Process:**
    - Implement stricter task prioritization
    - Create clear development timelines
    - Establish parallel workflow strategies

2. **Technical Improvements:**
    - Focus on completing core features first
    - Implement automated testing earlier
    - Establish code review checkpoints

3. **Resource Management:**
    - Better allocation of UI development time
    - Balance feature development with improvements
    - Plan for technical debt reduction
