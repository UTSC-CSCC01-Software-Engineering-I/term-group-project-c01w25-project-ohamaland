# Release Plan

## Release Name: Sprint 2 MVP Release

## Release Objectives
The objective of Sprint 2 is to build upon the core functionality developed in Sprint 1, improving backend stability, refining the receipt parsing system, enhancing UI elements, and implementing new features such as subscription tracking and group expense synchronization.

## Specific Goals

### Improve Backend Infrastructure
- Refine relational database structures.
- Cleanup redundant or outdated backend code.
- Standardize API responses for consistency.

### Enhance Receipt Management System
- Implement OCR-based receipt parsing for automatic data extraction.
- Enable manual addition of expenses to receipts.
- Improve the frontend display of receipt data.

### User Account & Authentication Features
- Allow new users to securely create accounts.
- Enable returning users to log in.
- Implement subscription tracking backend and frontend.

### Improve User Experience & Visuals
- Implement interactive graphs for receipt spending trends.
- Improve UI styling and layout refinements.
- Refactor frontend components for maintainability.

### Ensure System Reliability & Scalability
- Enhance synchronization between group members for shared expenses.
- Ensure robust error handling in backend APIs.
- Track and fix major usability and performance issues.

## Metrics for Measurement
- **Backend Stability:** Reduction in API response inconsistencies and errors.
- **OCR Accuracy Rate:** Percentage of correctly extracted receipt data.
- **Frontend Performance:** Load times for UI components and response times for dynamic elements.
- **Bug Resolution Rate:** Number of major issues resolved before release.

## Release Scope

### Included Features
- **Backend Enhancements:** Cleanup, API standardization, and database optimizations.
- **OCR Receipt Parsing:** Automatic extraction of data from uploaded receipts.
- **Expense Management:** Improved receipt item display and manual expense addition.
- **Authentication & Accounts:** User signup, login, and security enhancements.
- **Subscription Tracking:** Backend and frontend implementation.
- **Group Expense Synchronization:** Ensure real-time updates across users.
- **UI Improvements:** Graphs for spending trends, refined receipt views, and usability enhancements.

### Excluded Features
- **Third-Party Payment Integrations:** Not included due to readiness of basic necessities for these integrations.
- **Advanced Financial Analytics:** More complex analysis tools will be considered in future releases.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Currently focused on core features, localization will be planned later.

## Bug Fixes
- Resolved API inconsistencies in receipt retrieval.
