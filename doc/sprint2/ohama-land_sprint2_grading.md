# Sprint 2 Marking Scheme

**Team Name:** Ohama-Land  

---

## Version Control (max 10 marks)

- Consistent Usage of Git (5 pt):
  - 2 pts: Regular and consistent commits demonstrating incremental progress in the project.
  - 2 pt:  Demonstrated proficiency in basic Git commands (e.g., commit, push, pull, merge) and usage based on the contribution guidelines described by the team in their README.
  - 1 pts: Meaningful commit messages that convey the purpose of each change.

- Branches/Naming/Organization (5 pt)
  - 2 pts: Proper utilization of branches for feature development, bug fixes, etc. Should have feature branches for each user story that differs significantly in logic.
  - 2 pts: Use of Pull Requests and/or avoidance of direct uploads and merging zip files.
    - Should not directly commit each change to the main branch.
    - Should ideally merge branches using pull request feature on GitHub.
    - Should not manually merge zips from different branches in one local repo - bad practice
  - 1 pts: Clear and meaningful branch naming conventions that reflect the purpose of the branch.

Version Control Total Mark: 10 / 10

**Grader's Notes:** Keep up the consistent views and branch naming conventions! This is great, don't stop doing it because you can still be docked on this section if you slip up in later sprints.

- Each user story / task in Sprint 2 has been assigned story estimation points.
- All tasks/user stories in Sprint 2 should be completed.

Note (for TAs): a completed sprint may be hidden from the Backlog/Board.
  - You need to find/recover them manually.
  - Do not deduct marks for completed sprints, therefore stories that disappeared.

Deduct 1/1.5 marks for each criteria violated.

Backlog Management Total Mark: 9 / 10

**Grader's Notes:** Multiple stories have not been broken down into subtasks and child issues and there are a few child issues that are unclassified/have no parent story/epic.

——
## Project Tracking (max 10 marks)

- The burndown smoothly tracks progress, reflecting team velocity and workload.
- Network diagram to show the critical path and documenting the findings in schedule.pdf

Deduct 2/2.5 marks for each criteria violated.

If the burndown chart is flat, no marks should be provided
