## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

**When:** 2025-02-14  
**Where:** Online (Discord)  

## Process - Reflection

### Decisions that turned out well

#### **Using Django for Backend Development:**
- Initially, we debated between Django and Flask but settled on Django as it provided better built-in features and integration with MongoDB.
- This decision streamlined backend development and allowed for a quicker implementation of user authentication and database interactions.

#### **Task Prioritization Based on Dependencies:**
- Backend tasks were prioritized first to ensure frontend development could integrate smoothly.
- This prevented blockers where frontend components were waiting for API endpoints to be completed.

#### **Using MUI for Frontend Development:**
- Leveraging MUI Stack and Grid components simplified UI implementation.
- Saved time by avoiding custom styling from scratch and ensured a responsive layout.

#### **Regular Communication via Discord and Standups:**
- Frequent updates and discussions allowed the team to align progress.
- Issues were identified and resolved quickly, keeping development on track.

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

#### **Late Start on Some Tasks:**
- Some tasks were pushed towards the weekend due to multiple term tests, leading to restructuring some work.
- Earlier starts would have allowed more time for refinement.

#### **Unclear Initial Task Assignments:**
- Some members were unsure of what they needed to complete early in the sprint.
- Future iterations will have clearer initial assignments to avoid confusion.

#### **Uncertainty Around Database Choice:**
- Originally, we considered MongoDB but later realized PostgreSQL might be better suited for our needs.
- This caused some rework and delayed progress on backend endpoints.

## Planned Changes

### **Start Development Earlier in the Sprint:**
- Mohamed will make sure all team members begin their tasks earlier.

### **More Defined Task Assignments:**
- Clearly assign tasks at the beginning of the sprint to avoid ambiguity.
- Ensure each member knows their specific responsibilities.

## Product - Review

### **Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:**
- We have successfully completed all tasks planned for this release.
- The user authentication system, database setup, CRUD endpoints, and frontend UI components were all implemented as planned.
- All features were tested and are ready for integration into the next development cycle.
