# Ohama Land

## Iteration 01

**Start date:** 2025-02-03  
**End date:** 2025-02-15  

## Process

### Roles & Responsibilities
- **RJ & Mel:** Backend development - Database implementation.
- **Hari:** Data structures & mock data generation.
- **Leo:** Frontend development - UI components and integration.
- **Ohama:** Project coordination, ensuring sprint consistency, Backend CRUD endpoints and documentation.

### Events
- **Daily Standup Meetings:** Online, held at 10 PM.  
  **Purpose:** To review progress, discuss blockers, and plan next steps.
- **Code Review Sessions:** Conducted as needed on Discord.  
  **Purpose:** To ensure high code quality before merging into the main branch.
- **Sprint Review Meeting:** Scheduled at the end of the sprint to showcase progress.
- **Demo Preparation Meeting:** A session before the sprint demo to align on key talking points.

## Artifacts

- **Jira Board:** Used for task tracking and sprint planning.
  - Tasks have a difficulty rating on a scale from 1 to 5.
  - We sort tasks by urgency in planning meetings, considering their importance and impact on production.
  - For example, backend endpoints need to be completed before frontend UI to ensure proper integration.
  - Any changes are discussed in standups and through Discord for immediate updates.

### Task Assignment:
- Tasks are assigned in planning meetings based on the sprint goals.
- Assignment is sometimes based on expertise, ensuring the right person works on a task.
- Motivation also plays a roleâ€”if a team member is particularly interested in a task, they can take it on.

## Product

### Goals and Tasks
#### **User Authentication System**
- Implement user registration and login API.
- Establish PostgreSQL as the primary database.

#### **Receipts Management System**
- Develop CRUD endpoints for receipts.
- Implement receipt upload functionality.

#### **Frontend UI Development**
- Design and implement receipt display and editing UI.
- Integrate frontend components with backend APIs.

#### **Data Handling & Testing**
- Create mock receipt data for frontend testing.
- Ensure proper data structure alignment between backend and frontend.

## Artifacts

### **API Documentation (Code)**
- We maintain a structured API documentation using Postman to clearly define all backend endpoints.
- This ensures that frontend developers can understand how to interact with the backend efficiently.

### **Demo-ready Feature Implementations (Code & Video)**
- At least two working features will be implemented and demonstrated for the sprint review.
- A short recorded demo of the implemented features will be created to showcase system functionality.
- This helps with presentation preparation and allows everyone to understand progress.

### **Testing Reports (Text & Code)**
- We maintain testing logs that include manual and automated test results for backend and frontend functionality.
- This helps identify bugs early and ensures the stability of the system across different use cases.
