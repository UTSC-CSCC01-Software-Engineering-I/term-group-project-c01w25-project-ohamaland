## 3. Key Insights

### Disorganized Receipts
Traditional paper receipts are often lost or damaged. Users need a system that digitizes receipts and automatically extracts relevant data (date, amount, store name, line items, etc.).

### Painful Expense Splitting
Without a dedicated tool, splitting bills among multiple people leads to confusion, errors, and friction. A dedicated “Groups” feature with a clear dashboard streamlines cost-sharing.

### Recurring Subscriptions Go Unchecked
Many users overlook or forget certain recurring charges (like Netflix, Spotify, or niche services) until they see an unexpected bank statement. Automatic detection of subscriptions and timely reminders can save money and reduce stress.

### Finance Visibility & Analytics
Most people do not have a holistic view of their spending patterns. By aggregating receipts and linking bank transactions, we can provide powerful analytics to guide better financial decisions.

### Enhanced Security & Trust
Users need confidence that their financial data and personal information are safe. Implementing reliable encryption (e.g., AES-256) and security measures fosters trust and adoption.

## 4. Key Decisions Leading to Our Planned Product

### Choice of Technology Stack
- **OCR:** Tesseract or Google Vision API for accurate text extraction from receipts.
- **Backend:** Django for rapid development and easy integration with third-party services like Plaid or Flinks.
- **Database:** A secure and scalable relational or NoSQL database to handle structured receipt data and group expense records.
- **Frontend:** A modern framework such as Next.js or React for a responsive, modular user interface.

### Financial Aggregators
Integrations with Plaid or Flinks allow users to automatically fetch transactions from their bank accounts, reducing manual data entry and improving accuracy.

### Subscription Monitoring
- Parsing emails for key phrases like “Your subscription will renew soon.”
- Automated reminders and direct links to cancel or modify subscriptions.

### Security Priorities
- **Encryption:** Using AES-256 for storing sensitive receipt data.
- **Prevent Common Attacks:** Implement robust checks for XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.

### Focus on the “Groups” Feature
- Simplify the logic for cost splitting to reduce friction among users and provide a clear dashboard to see who owes what.
